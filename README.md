🏡 House Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project
📌 Project Overview
This project predicts house prices based on various features like area, location, number of rooms, and amenities. It demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline—from data preprocessing to model deployment—making it ideal for learners and developers aiming to build real-world ML applications.

🚀 Features
- End-to-end ML pipeline using Scikit-learn
- Data cleaning, encoding, scaling, and feature engineering
- Comparison of Linear, Lasso, and Ridge Regression models
- Evaluation using R² Score, MAE, and MSE
- Interactive web app built with Streamlit / Flask
- Modular codebase with app.py
- Professional UI with sidebar navigation and result placement
- Optional deployment on GitHub
